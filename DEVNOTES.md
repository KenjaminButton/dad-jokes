# Development Notes

## Technical Decisions

### API Integration
- Using the icanhazdadjoke API (https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api)
- Implemented with fetch API for modern browser compatibility
- Added User-Agent header to identify our application
- Using JSON format for data exchange

### Code Organization
- Separated concerns into three files:

  - CSS: All styling
  - JavaScript: All functionality
- Used modern ES6+ features (async/await)
- Implemented error handling for API failures

### Styling Decisions
- Modern, clean interface
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Loading states for better UX
- Subtle animations for interactivity
- Accessible color contrast ratios

### Performance Considerations
- No external dependencies
- Minimal DOM manipulations
- Efficient error handling
- Console logging for debugging
